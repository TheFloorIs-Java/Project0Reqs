# Project 0
Must haves:
Console Line Application
Must leverage a SQL database for persisting data (use jdbc, we must have at minimum both read and write functionality)
Package project into a jar using Gradle and run it as a jar

Good to haves:
CRUD
README documentation for users
Input checking
Log4j logging
Junit testing
Multiple sql tables

Topic:
Anything, eg
* Diary keeping apps
* Movie recommendation apps
* Financial planners
* Text adventure games
* Stores

Don't make your idea too much to explain in a 5 minute demo to people who have
no idea about your app.

demo structure: 
1. technical demonstration of functionality
2. we'll probably ask you if you have completed certain requirements (eg do you have unit testing?)

## tentative due date: 6-7 september
