# Project 0
Primary requirements:

* Console Line Application
* Must leverage a SQL database for persisting data (use jdbc, we must have at minimum both read and write functionality)
* Remote git repository
* Create-Read-Update-Delete functionality, unless it's not applicable

Secondary requirements, in order of priority, greatest to least:

* Multiple sql tables (2 or more if applicable)
* Package project into a jar using Gradle and run it as a jar
* Input checking (eg you require a number, but the user inputs a name - handle this gracefully)
* README documentation for users
* Log4j logging (ideally log for each user action)
* Junit testing (you should try out the code coverage feature in intellij - don't focus on testing the user input layer or methods that interact with the database - you can focus on just your 'business logic' - what would typically go in the service layer)

Topic:
Anything, eg
* Diary keeping apps
* Movie recommendation apps
* Financial planners
* Text adventure games
* Stores

Don't make your idea too much to explain in a 5-10 minute demo to people who have
no idea about your app.

demo structure: 
1. technical demonstration of functionality
2. we'll probably ask you if you have completed certain requirements (eg do you have unit testing?)

## tentative due date: 6 september
